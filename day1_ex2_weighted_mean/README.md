Task 
=====
Given an array, X, of N integers and an array, W, representing the respective weights of X's elements,
calculate and print the weighted mean of X's elements. 
Your answer should be rounded to a scale of 1 decimal place (i.e 12.3 format)

Input Format
=============
The first line contains an integer, N, denoting the number of elements in arrays X and W. 
The second line contains N space-separated integers describing the respective elements of array X. 
The third line contains N space-separated integers describing the respective elements of array W.

Constraints
============
5 <= N <= 50
0 < x_i <= 100, where x_i is the ith element of array X.
0 < w_i <= 100, where w_i is the ith element of array W.

Output Format
==============
Print the weighted mean on a new line. Your answer should be rounded to a scale of 1 decimal place (i.e., 12.3 format).
